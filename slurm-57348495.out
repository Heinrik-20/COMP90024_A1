Usage: /apps/common/bin/my-job-stats [Options] -j <Jobid> [-a|-c|-d|-s|-v]
     Options:
             -a --overall   Display the overall CPU/GPU usage metrics for a running job since it started
             -c --current   Display the current CPU/GPU usage metrics for a running job 
             -h --help      Help menu
             -j --jobid     Job id
             -n --no-color  Do not colorize the usage stats
             -s --sleep     Only to be used in job submit scripts to ensure that runtime of the job is atleast 30 secs before listing metrics.
                            Without this option, very short jobs with less than 30 secs runtime may return invalid resource usage stats
             -v --verbose   Verbose mode
             -d --debug     Debug mode to dump raw slurm job data
